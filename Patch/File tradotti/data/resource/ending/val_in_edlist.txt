The 25th day of October, 1935--
The death of Maximilian, commander of the Empire's invasion
of Gallia, paved the way for truce between the two nations.
After seven tumultuous months at war, Gallians everywhere
looked forward to a time of hard-won peace
Squad 7 of the Gallian militia disbanded shortly after
the conflict's conclusion,
and its members began to move on
each following his or her own path.
And here, at the end of their long struggle
I lay my pen to rest.
